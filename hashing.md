# Hashing in Blockchain

## What is Hashing?
Hashing is the process of converting data into a fixed-length output called a hash.

## Why Hashing is Important?
- Ensures data integrity
- Links blocks securely
- Prevents data tampering

## Properties of Hashing
- Fixed length
- One-way function
- Deterministic
- Avalanche effect

## Role in Blockchain
Each block stores its own hash and the previous block’s hash.
Any change breaks the chain.

## Conclusion
Hashing makes blockchain secure and immutable.
